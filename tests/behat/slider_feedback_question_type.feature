Feature: In questionnaire, slider questions can be defined with scores attributed to specific answers, in order
  to provide score dependent feedback.
  In order to define a feedback question
  As a teacher
  I must add a required slider question type.

  Scenario: Create a questionnaire with a slider question type and verify that feedback options exist.
    Given the following "users" exist:

      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |

    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | name | description | course | idnumber | resume | navigate |
      | questionnaire | Test questionnaire | Test questionnaire description | C1 | questionnaire0 | 1 | 1 |
