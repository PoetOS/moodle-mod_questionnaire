New features:
The feedback options UI has been completely overhauled. The feedback UI is now accessed from the module settings menu and tabs.
Each section can now be easily accessed and managed on one page. Questions are now assigned to sections rather than sections
assigned to questions.

Rate question usability improvements, specifically a mouse click on table cell selects the radio button as well.

Report now uses number of of participants instead of number of responses for averages on questions that have optional responses
(e.g. checkboxes).

Numeric question responses now allow comma decimal separator as well as period.

Data export now uses the more of the Moodle export API, and exports with 'CSV' extension rather than 'TXT'.

Incomplete responses can now be selected for export with the CSV export function.

In exported data, anonymous responses are assigned unique identifiers, so that responses from the same anonymous submitter can be
grouped.

Thanks to C. Jobst & Y. Annanias of the University of Leipzig and the Online-Self-Assessment project for the Faculty of Economics
and Management Science, funded by the EU/ESF (The European Social Fund in Germany) for the resources and efforts for these features.
